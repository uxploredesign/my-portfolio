                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Inspired by being taught that I could do anything I set my mind to, I've embarked on a varied
                        career journey, always seeking the right fit for my passions and goals, much like Goldilocks
                        trying the porridge and beds. I initially pursued fitness and nutrition, earning a certification
                        with dreams of changing lives. However, living in the party city of Miami and realizing my young
                        peers favored partying over wellness, I pivoted my focus to personal use and helping those who
                        approached me. Drawn to sustainability, I then entered electrical engineering, only to discover
                        the path to impactful innovation was more complex than being a bright mind with great ideas.
                        This realization led me to media and production through connections, where I thrived as a
                        content producer and manager, while dabbling in accounting in hopes of creating a business to
                        help freelancers - but accounting was too restrictive. My career journey has continually
                        evolved, leading me back to freelancing in creative roles, always guided by the belief instilled
                        in me from those early lectures. You might be thinking "She's indecisive", but in actuality I'm
                        tenacious, self-motivated, and determined to do something that fits who I am and my goals. Human
                        beings spend the majority of our lives working, would you spend most of your life doing
                        something you dislike, that doesn't fit who you are or your goals? When I was a kid, my teacher
                        told my class to write what we wanted to be when we grew up and I simply wrote "to be happy."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now let’s get to the fun part- discovering UX. I discovered UX design by chance one night while
                        scrolling through Instagram. A woman's facial expression caught my attention, so I tapped on her
                        video. It was about her day-to-day life as a UX Designer. "What's UX Design?" I thought to
                        myself, so I did some research and found that it was both analytical and creative, like me. I
                        realized I was already doing many of the tasks she mentioned like research, project management,
                        and creating digital products but was intrigued more so by the fact that UX is about solving
                        problems and creating experiences. After taking an intro course, I looked into schools and
                        signed up for a program. A few months later, I was excitedly beginning my first competitive
                        analysis, wireframes, and user interviews. A year after that, I started my own business, UXplore
                        Design & Media, inspired by my passion for UX and now I have my certification in UX. I wish I
                        could remember who that woman was so I could thank her for her inspiring videos because they led
                        me to discover a fulfilling career path that aligns with who I am, my desire to solve problems,
                        my high curiosity drive and my creative side. <br>
                        <br>
                        Today, after a decade of being an entrepreneur in online business, mixed with my training in UX
                        Design, I’ve really been able to understand people even better. Being in a business based on
                        content production and management, you interact with a lot of different characters of people,
                        and I’ve spent the past decade learning about them, their interests, needs, goals, influences,
                        and what keeps them around. The human mind mixed with the human heart is a fascinating
                        combination to need to create for. I’m excited to see what I get to be a part of, what problems
                        I’ll get to solve, and what people I’ll get to collaborate with in this pursuit. I see myself
                        being a part of innovative teams, bringing designs that better or simplify lives and I can’t
                        wait to see where it leads.
